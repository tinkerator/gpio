# gpio - a package for using GPIOs under Linux

## Overview

The `gpio` package provides a native Go interface to the Linux GPIO
subsystem. The kernel API that the package uses is the _modern_ V2
character device one.

Automated package documentation for this Go package should be
available from [![Go
Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/zappem.net/pub/io/gpio.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/zappem.net/pub/io/gpio).

## Getting started

Cross compiling to make a Raspberry Pi binary can be done as follows:
```
$ GOARCH=arm GOOS=linux go build tools/gpioutil.go
```

On a Raspberry Pi, running the compiled binary, `gpioutil`, on a
system with only one pair of pins connected (connect pin<18> and
pin<21>) will generate the indicated output:

```
pi@mypi:~ $ ./gpioutil --gpios=/dev/gpiochip0:18,19,20:21,22,23 --trace
2023/01/29 21:15:13 preparing <18>"GPIO18"[""](unused,active-high,input) for use as input

```

Here, the optional `--trace` argument logs the GPIO values
(`<0>"ID_SDA"` is the right most 0) in this output. Note, `<18>`
transitions to `1` after `<21>` is raised to `1` because of the wired
connection. Similarly, `<18>` lowers after `<21>` is lowered. Without
that wired connection, `<18>` is unchanged.

The optional argument `--vcd` can be used to generate a VCD trace file
instead of the simple one shown in the log above. To do this, you use
the following command line:

```
pi@mypi:~ $ ./gpioutil --gpios=/dev/gpiochip0:18,19,20:21,22,23 --trace --vcd=dump.vcd
```

The generated `dump.vcd` file can be viewed with
[`twave`](https://github.com/tinkerator/twave) or
[GTKWave](https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/). In the case of the
former, the output looks like this:
```
$ ./twave --file dump.vcd 
[] : [$version iotracer $end]

For debugging purposes, I've been using a `HCDC HD040 Ver. 1.0` RPi
_hat_ which has some helpful LEDs on it to show the state of the
GPIOs as well as alternate connectors.

## TODOs

We might consider implementing an alternate backend `gpio.OpenFile()`
based access model. One that mirrors the `ioctl` based functions with
the legacy GPIO `/sys/class/gpio` files. However, some experimentation
with that indicates it is noticeably slower than the more modern one.

## License info

The `gpio` package is distributed with the same BSD 3-clause license
as that used by [golang](https://golang.org/LICENSE) itself.

## Reporting bugs and feature requests

The package `gpio` has been developed purely out of self-interest and
a curiosity for debugging physical IO projects, primarily on the
Raspberry Pi. Should you find a bug or want to suggest a feature
addition, please use the [bug
tracker](https://github.com/tinkerator/gpio/issues).
